Some of my little projects and results of my study about code


1.ShapeOfYou - that old project was my first meeting with the object-oriented programming. Its simple WinApi C++ application that can draw diffrent shapes (change shapes only in code).

2.PaladinVsKnight - next adventure with C++, just simple console game.

3.BibliotekCDLP - that was my first program using List. That application is Library archive (we can add, remove, show everythink and save to file)

4.Saper - just another console game but this time written in Java.

5.TicTacToe - my first game with graphic interface written in Java (AWT Swing).
